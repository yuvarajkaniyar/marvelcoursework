##COMMON TASK REPORT
### 1)Task: Get familiar with the command line on ubuntu and do the following subtasks

I was \pro noob\" in knowing about UBANTU and about its command lines. After this course work I know the basics of it and simple use cases of Ubantu command lines.

Here  I used ls to list the files and folders.


To create folders i used mkdir command and created folder named 'test'.


Then i used cd test to get into that folder.


To create files I used touch command and created yuva.txt file.


And I finally used echo command to add text in files and cat command to display the file in it.

### 2) Tinker cad
Before getting into Marvel's coursework I was already knew Tinker cad and its basic functions by my friends. 
It was easy task to me and completed with so much passion.

 I have to build a circuit of aurdino uno board and ultrasound sensor with display attached to it which measures the distance at which object is placed Infront of ultrasonic sensor.
I am copied the resource code and completed the circuit diagram and uploaded code to board. I knew basic function of it  hence it was easy job to do.

##LEVEL 1 TASKS REPORT
### Task 1 ULTRASONIC SENSOR
The Ultrasonic sensor is the sensor which measures distance between the object and sensors using ultrasound signals. Arduino board attached to sensor will analyze the time taken to transmit and receive signal back and give distance as output. To get distance as output we can use different library files attached to code. I used Ultrasonic.h library file because it was more convenient to use.

### Task 2 TEMPERATURE DETECTION
LM35 is the temperature detecting sensor which will give voltage output proportional to the Temperature. Using arduino board with simple library we can calculate the Temperature around BJT (sensor). We can calculate temperature from -55'c to +155'c.

### Task 4 BATTERY CHARGING
This one was the simple task in which I needed to charge lithium polymer batteries using solar panel. For that  I used Li ion battery charging module which will regulate the power supply to the battery and keep it safe. I used voltage step-up boost module to get constant output power of 5VA to change my mobile.

### Task 5 UNDERSTANDING 555 TIMER AND LDR

In this task I have built a basic Headlight Circuit which turns on when there is no light in the surrounding. For that I used IC555 timed and LDR sensor which will detect the amount of light in surrounding. whenever there is no light in surrounding LED will start lighting up. Since there was no 47ohm sensor in my kit I used 4 220 ohms resistors and connected in parallel to get approx 47 ohms resistance.

## LEVEL 3 TASK

### 1) Task: Chassis Design
In this task, I designed a chassis for the RC car using Fusion 360 and Tinkercad, ensuring that the design would be compatible with the 3D printer available at MARVEL. Initially, I had limited experience with CAD software, but through practice, I developed a strong understanding of how to create a stable and efficient chassis. The design process involved balancing weight distribution to optimize the carâ€™s performance during operation. I also learned how to anticipate potential issues such as stress points and how to reinforce the structure accordingly.

*Key Learnings:*
- Mastered basic and advanced CAD design techniques.
- Understood the importance of weight distribution in vehicle stability.
- Gained hands-on experience with 3D printing, from design to physical realization.

### 2) Task: SPI Communication
This task required setting up SPI communication between two microcontrollers, an arduino uno as the master and an another arduino as the slave. Initially, I had only a theoretical understanding of SPI, but this task allowed me to delve into the practical aspects. I learned how SPI enables simultaneous data transmission and reception (full-duplex), and how to manage the clock signal for synchronization. Troubleshooting communication errors also helped me understand the importance of correct wiring and timing.

*Key Learnings:*
- Developed practical skills in setting up and configuring SPI communication.
- Learned to handle clock synchronization and data integrity.
- Gained experience in debugging and resolving communication issues.

### 3) Task: I2C Control
In this task, I implemented I2C communication to control multiple sensors connected to a single master microcontroller. I2C is more versatile than SPI because it allows multiple devices to share the same communication bus. Through this task, I learned to manage the bus addressing and understood the challenges of handling multiple slave devices. I also explored the advantages of I2C in reducing the number of pins required for communication, making it ideal for projects with limited GPIO availability.

### 4) Task: Speed Control of BLDC Motor
This task involved controlling the speed of a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor using a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller. BLDC motors are known for their efficiency and precision, which are critical in applications such as electric vehicles. I learned how to use a PI controller to regulate the motor's speed, providing a balance between responsiveness and stability. Observing the motor's performance on a CRO helped me understand how different control parameters affect the motor's behavior.

### 5) Task: Integration of Multiple Sensors
The final task was to integrate multiple sensors into the RC car, utilizing the chassis designed in Task 1. This task required combining the knowledge and skills gained from the previous tasks, including SPI, I2C, and motor control. I selected three sensors to provide critical data, such as distance measurement in different angles. The integration process taught me how to manage complex systems where multiple communication protocols are involved, ensuring that the sensors worked together seamlessly to enhance the car's functionality.
