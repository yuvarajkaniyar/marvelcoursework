Here i am mentioned  the basic details of me.\n![gf](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/portfolio.png?raw=true)\n\n\n\n##LEVEL 1 TASKS REPORT\n### Task 1 ULTRASONIC SENSOR\nThe Ultrasonic sensor is the sensor which measures distance between the object and sensors using ultrasound signals. Arduino board attached to sensor will analyze the time taken to transmit and receive signal back and give distance as output. To get distance as output we can use different library files attached to code. I used Ultrasonic.h library file because it was more convenient to use.\n![gf1](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/ultrasonic.png)\n\n\n### Task 2 TEMPERATURE DETECTION\nLM35 is the temperature detecting sensor which will give voltage output proportional to the Temperature. Using arduino board with simple library we can calculate the Temperature around BJT (sensor). We can calculate temperature from -55\'c to +155\'c.\n![gf](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/tempnormal.jpg)\n![gf2](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/dh11.jpg)\n\n\n### Task 3 TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY DETECTION\nDH11 is the sensor with 3 terminals ( VCC Gnd and Data) with will measure surrounding temperate and humidity. Here I wrote a simple code to measure temperature and humidity. Accuracy is higher than analog sensor.\n![gf3](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/dh111.jpg)\n![gf4](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/dh11se.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Task 4 BATTERY CHARGING\nThis one was the simple task in which I needed to charge lithium polymer batteries using solar panel. For that  I used Li ion battery charging module which will regulate the power supply to the battery and keep it safe. I used voltage step-up boost module to get constant output power of 5VA to change my mobile.\n![gf5](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/solar.jpg)\n![gf6](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/solar1.jpg)\n\n\n### Task 5 UNDERSTANDING 555 TIMER AND LDR\n\nIn this task I have built a basic Headlight Circuit which turns on when there is no light in the surrounding. For that I used IC555 timed and LDR sensor which will detect the amount of light in surrounding. whenever there is no light in surrounding LED will start lighting up. Since there was no 47ohm sensor in my kit I used 4 220 ohms resistors and connected in parallel to get approx 47 ohms resistance.\n![gf](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/ldrvid.mp4)\n![gf](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/ldr4.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Task 5 SPEED CONTROL OF DC MOTOR \n![gf7](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/ldrvid.mp4)\n![gf8](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/rotate%20bot.mp4)\n\n\n\n\n###Task 6 DIRECTION CONTROL OF DC MOTOR\n![gf](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/motor1.jpg)\n![gf](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/motorspeed.jpg)\n\n\n### 7 Task 7 POINT TURN OF A VEHICLE\n![gf](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/rotate%20bot.mp4)\n![gf](https://github.com/yuvarajkaniyar/marvelcoursework/blob/main/motorpotentio.jpg)\n\n"
